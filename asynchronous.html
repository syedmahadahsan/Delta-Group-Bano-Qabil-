    <h1>Asynchronous JavaScript</h1>
    <img src="/asynchronous js 2.png" alt="asynchronous js" height="300">
    <br>
    <p>After following this tutorial, you will be familiar with Asynchronous Javascript.</p>
    <p>But before we dive into that, we need to make sure you understand what Synchronous code is and how it works.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>What is Synchronous Code?</h1>
    <p>Synchronous code is a type of code execution where operations are performed sequentially, with each operation waiting for the previous one to complete before starting.</p>
    <p>Let's look at an example of this:</p>

    <pre><code>
        function task1() {
            console.log("Task 1: Start");
            for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {} // Simulate a time-consuming task
            console.log("Task 1: End");
        }
        
        function task2() {
            console.log("Task 2: Start");
            console.log("Task 2: End");
        }
        
        task1();
        task2();
            </code></pre>

            <p>When the script runs, it first logs "Task 1: Start" to the console, then performs a time-consuming loop, and logs "Task 1: End". Immediately after, it logs "Task 2: Start" followed by "Task 2: End". The output sequence demonstrates synchronous execution, where task2 starts only after task1 has fully completed, resulting in the console output.</p>

            <h1>What is Asynchronous Code?</h1>
            <p>Asynchronous code is a type of code execution where operations can run independently of the main program flow, allowing tasks to start and complete without waiting for previous tasks to finish.</p>
            <p>Let's see an example of asynchronous code:</p>

            <pre><code>
                function task1() {
                    console.log("Task 1: Start");
                    setTimeout(() => {
                        console.log("Task 1: End");
                    }, 2000); // Simulates a 2-second delay
                }
                
                function task2() {
                    console.log("Task 2: Start");
                    console.log("Task 2: End");
                }
                
                task1();
                task2();
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>When the script runs, it first logs "Task 1: Start" and then schedules "Task 1: End" to be logged after a 2-second delay. Immediately, it logs "Task 2: Start" and "Task 2: End". Finally, after the delay, "Task 1: End" is logged. This demonstrates asynchronous execution, with the output sequence.</p>

                    <h1>How Promises Work in JavaScript</h1>
                    <p>In JavaScript, a `Promise` is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. A promise is created using the `Promise` constructor, which takes a function called the executor. The executor function contains the asynchronous operation and has two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`. When the operation completes successfully, `resolve` is called with the result, and the promise transitions to the "fulfilled" state. If the operation fails, `reject` is called with the error, transitioning the promise to the "rejected" state. Promises have `then` and `catch` methods to handle fulfilled or rejected states respectively. `then` is used to specify what to do with the result when the promise is fulfilled, while `catch` handles any errors. This chaining allows for more readable and manageable asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions.</p>
                    <p>Now let's look at a code example:</p>

                    <pre><code>
                        function asyncOperation(success) {
                            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                                setTimeout(() => {
                                    if (success) {
                                        resolve("Operation was successful!");
                                    } else {
                                        reject("Operation failed.");
                                    }
                                }, 2000); // Simulate a 2-second delay
                            });
                        }
                        
                        asyncOperation(true)
                            .then(result => {
                                console.log(result);
                            })
                            .catch(error => {
                                console.error(error);
                            });
                        
                        asyncOperation(false)
                            .then(result => {
                                console.log(result);
                            })
                            .catch(error => {
                                console.error(error);
                            });
                            </code></pre>

                            <p>In this example, the `asyncOperation` function simulates an asynchronous task using a promise that resolves or rejects after a 2-second delay based on the `success` argument. When called with `true`, the promise resolves successfully, logging "Operation was successful!" to the console. When called with `false`, the promise rejects, logging "Operation failed." This demonstrates how promises handle asynchronous operations by chaining `then` to process successful results and `catch` to handle errors, allowing for clean and manageable asynchronous code.</p>

                            <h2>How to Consume Promises</h2>
                            <p>To consume promises in JavaScript, use the `then` method to handle a promise's successful resolution and the `catch` method to handle any errors. After a promise is created and executed, call `then` to specify what should happen when the promise is fulfilled, receiving the result as an argument. Chain `catch` to handle any errors if the promise is rejected. This chaining allows for sequential handling of asynchronous operations and their results, making code more readable and manageable.</p>
                            <p>Let's continue using the above example to understand how we can consume a promise.</p>

                            <pre><code>
                                function asyncOperation(success) {
                                    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                                        setTimeout(() => {
                                            if (success) {
                                                resolve("Operation was successful!");
                                            } else {
                                                reject("Operation failed.");
                                            }
                                        }, 2000); // Simulate a 2-second delay
                                    });
                                }
                                
                                // Consuming the promise with .then() and .catch()
                                asyncOperation(true)
                                    .then(result => {
                                        console.log(result); // Logs success message
                                    })
                                    .catch(error => {
                                        console.error(error); // Handles any error
                                    });
                                
                                asyncOperation(false)
                                    .then(result => {
                                        console.log(result); // This will not run
                                    })
                                    .catch(error => {
                                        console.error(error); // Logs failure message
                                    });
                                    </code></pre>

                                    <p>In this example, promises are consumed using `.then()` and `.catch()`. When `asyncOperation(true)` is called, the promise resolves successfully after a 2-second delay, logging "Operation was successful!" via `.then()`. When `asyncOperation(false)` is called, the promise rejects, and the error is caught and logged as "Operation failed." via `.catch()`. This demonstrates handling asynchronous results and errors in a clear and manageable way.</p>
